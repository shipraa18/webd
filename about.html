                    Introducing "Early Forest Fire Prediction" – a groundbreaking project leveraging IoT and AI technologies to safeguard our forests. Our smart sensor box, equipped with temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed sensors, transmits real-time data via WiFi to Firebase. The data is seamlessly integrated into our SVM-based ML model, predicting the likelihood of a fire outbreak. Upon detecting a potential threat, our system activates a camera capturing images, processed by YOLOv5 through HTTP, confirming the presence of fire.
                    In the event of a confirmed fire, instant alerts are dispatched to the forest department, ensuring swift response. Simultaneously, our GSM module relays the precise fire location, expediting the rescue efforts. This comprehensive solution not only facilitates early detection but also employs cutting-edge technologies like OpenCV and YOLOv5 for rapid and accurate fire confirmation. A fusion of environmental monitoring, machine learning, and real-time communication, our system is a vital step towards proactive forest preservation. Join us in revolutionizing wildfire prevention for a greener future.
